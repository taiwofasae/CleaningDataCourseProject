==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

This assignment makes use of data from the following website:

======================================================

* README.md: readme file
* Code_book.pdf: explaining the dataset labels
* TidyData.txt: output
* run_analysis.R: the R Script creates the output file

**R Programming Script**

run_analysis.R

- data downloaded and extracted into working directory

First, the R script requires two packages: ddply and reshape2

**Steps**
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
